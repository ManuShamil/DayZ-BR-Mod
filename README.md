## Introduction
Welcome to the ultimate survival experience! Our Battle Royale mod transforms DayZ into a high-stakes, adrenaline-pumping showdown. Prepare for intense battles, strategic team play, and a race against both the clock and the encroaching danger.

## 🏁 Lobby: The Gathering Storm
- **⏳ Countdown to Chaos**: Feel the tension rise as the editable countdown timer ticks down, signaling the onset of survival drama.
- **👥 Forming the Squads**: Teams form in the crucible of the lobby. With a minimum player count required to kick off the countdown, strategy starts here. Create a squad with up to 4 warriors (configurable to your liking).
- **🔀 Dynamic Team Assembly**: Solo players, fear not! You'll be automatically assigned to a group with open slots, ensuring everyone has a fighting chance.

## 🕹️ Play: The Survival Saga
- **📍 United We Stand**: Teammates spawn together, fostering camaraderie and collective strategy from the outset.
- **🚀 The Phases of Peril**: The game unfolds in a series of increasingly challenging phases:
  - **🌐 Safe Havens and Deadly Shores**: Each phase is defined by a 'safe radius,' a haven amidst the chaos. Outside these bounds, a lethal toxic zone awaits, threatening to choke the life from the unwary.
  - **🔥 The Crucible Closes**: As the game progresses, these safe zones shrink, herding combatants into an ever-tightening theater of war.

## 💥 Loot Mechanics: Spoils of War
- **🎁 Tactical Resupply**: In a twist to DayZ's classic looting, buildings now spawn specialized crates.
  - **🔓 Unlocking the Arsenal**: These crates, when opened, release a bounty of equipment onto the battleground, echoing the style of Call of Duty's loot system.
  - **🌈 The Crate Lottery**: The type of crate governs the rarity and power of the gear unleashed, adding a layer of strategic anticipation to every discovery.

Join us in this heart-pounding mod, where quick thinking, teamwork, and a flair for the dramatic are your keys to survival and glory!
